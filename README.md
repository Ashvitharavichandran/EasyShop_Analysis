## **Customer Reviews** Sentiment Analysis Using Python

Developed a comprehensive workflow to extract insights from customer reviews. Reviewed the dataset to understand its structure and quality, then used **Python** to process the data and connected it to an **SQL database** for efficient extraction and manipulation.

Calculated **sentiment scores** for each review, categorized them into **sentiment categories**, and created **sentiment buckets** for easier analysis. Applied this process across relevant columns and **generated an Excel sheet** with separate columns for **Sentiment Score, Sentiment Category, and Sentiment Bucket**, providing a clear and structured view of customer feedback. This workflow delivered actionable insights, enabling **data-driven decisions** to improve engagement and satisfaction.
